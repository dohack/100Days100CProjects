# CSV to Text File Parser

Welcome to the **CSV to Text File Parser** project! This program demonstrates how to parse a CSV (Comma-Separated Values) file and convert it into a tab-delimited text file. Built in C, this project is perfect for understanding file I/O, string manipulation, and basic data processing.

## üöÄ Introduction

This project provides a simple utility to transform CSV data into a more human-readable text format. The output is a tab-delimited text file where each row of the CSV is preserved, making it easier to read and analyze data without the need for complex software.

**Features:**

- **Read CSV Files**: Parse CSV files with up to 20 columns and 1000 rows.
- **Write to Text Files**: Convert CSV data into a tab-delimited text file.
- **Dynamic Column Handling**: Automatically adjusts to the number of columns in the CSV file.

## üìú Project Overview

This tool reads a CSV file and writes its content into a tab-delimited text file. It processes the file line by line, handling headers and rows, and outputs the data in a clean and organized format.

### Key Components

- **CSV Parsing**: Reads and splits CSV lines into columns.
- **Header Handling**: Extracts and writes header names to the output file.
- **Data Writing**: Writes each row of data to the text file, maintaining tabular structure.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

### 1. **Requirements**

- **C Compiler**: A C compiler like GCC or AVR-GCC.
- **Development Environment**: Any standard C development environment or text editor.

### 2. **Installation**

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dohack/100Days100CProjects.git
   cd 100Days100CProjects/Day-012-CSV-Parser
   ```

2. **Compile the Code**

   Use the following command to compile the code:

   ```bash
   gcc -o csv_to_text_parser main.c
   ```

3. **Run the Program**

   Ensure you have a CSV file named `data.csv` in the same directory. This file is generated by the [Day-011-Database-Generator](https://github.com/dohack/100Days100CProjects/tree/main/Day-011-Database-Generator) project. Then run the compiled program:

   ```bash
   ./csv_to_text_parser
   ```

4. **Check Output**

   The output will be saved to `parsed_data.txt` in the same directory.

### 3. **Configuration**

- **Adjust Column and Row Limits**: Modify `MAX_COLS` and `MAX_ROWS` in `main.c` if you need to handle more columns or rows.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Usage

After running the program, check the `parsed_data.txt` file for the converted data. Each column in the CSV will be separated by tabs in the text file, and rows will be maintained.

**Example CSV Input:**

```plaintext
First Name,Last Name,Age,Sex,Mobile Number,Country Code,Address 1,Address 2,Email ID,Password,Pin Code,Country
Name1,Last1,33,Male,1234567890,+91,demo Address,demo Address,demo@demo.com,123456,123456,India
...
```

**Example Text Output:**

```plaintext
First Name	Last Name	Age	Sex	Mobile Number	Country Code	Address 1	Address 2	Email ID	Password	Pin Code	Country
Name1	Last1	33	Male	1234567890	+91	demo Address	demo Address	demo@demo.com	123456	123456	India
...
```

## üîß Example Projects

Use this utility to:

- **Clean and Convert Data**: Convert CSV data to a more readable format for reports or data analysis.
- **Integrate with Other Tools**: Use the text output in other applications or scripts that require tab-delimited input.
